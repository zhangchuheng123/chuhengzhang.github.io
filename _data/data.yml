career-profile:
  title: I am Chuheng (Seal) Zhang
  summary: |
    Currently, I am a Researcher/Post-doc in <b>Microsoft Research Asia</b>.
    My research interest is on <b>reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the era of foundation models</b>, 
    including RL for foundation models (e.g., alignment, RLHF) and 
    foundation models for control (e.g., embodied AI).
    I am enthusiastic about foundation models for practical industrial problems, 
    and have wide cooperation with industrial teams from different fields including 
    quantitative investment, recommending systems, dialog systems, and inventory management.
    I have published 30+ papers in ICLR, ICML, AAAI, WWW, SIGIR, CIKM, ICDM, etc., 
    and I serve as the reviewer in top AI conferences and journals.
    I have been granted the best student paper award runner-up in ICDM-22 and
    several competition awards in 
    ABC Credit Risk Prediction Contest, UBIQUANT Quantitative Trading Contest, etc.

  intro: >
    I am facinated by the goal of artifical general intellegence (AGI), 
    and believe in the role of reinforcement learning (RL) can play in the path to AGI.
    RL is the way how a human baby learns from born, and it is also the way I learn - 
    keeping curious, exploring, failing fast, and learning fast.
